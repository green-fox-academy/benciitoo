           <h2 class="pink">Developer padawan</h2>

           <p>I would like to learn the (not so) secret art of
              software developing. My main interest is test
              automation, but that might change over time.
           </p>
           
          <p>When my master took me before the Developer Council, 
              the Developer Masters said I'm too old, and there's 
              too much confusion in me. Confusion leads to anger. 
              Anger leads to hate. And hate leads to the dark
              side of the code. 
          </p>

           <h2>Logic Gate</h2>
           <p>It is an idealized or physical device implementing a 
              Boolean function; that is, it performs a logical 
              operation on one or more binary inputs and produces a 
              single binary output.</p>

           <h2>ASCII</h2>
           <p>It stands for American Standard Code for Information 
              Interchange. Computers can only understand numbers, so 
              it is the numerical representation of a character such 
              as 'a' or '@' or an action of some sort.</p>

           <h2>Random Access Memory</h2>
           <p>It is a form of computer data storage which stores 
              frequently used program instructions to increase the 
              general speed of a system. It can be randomly accessed. 
              Data items to be read or written in almost the same 
              amount of time irrespective of the physical location of 
              data inside the memory.</p>

           <h2>Computer language</h2>
           <p>A hierarchical decentralized naming system for 
              computers, services, or other resources connected to 
              the Internet or a private network. It associates 
              various information with domain names assigned to 
              each of the participating entities.</p>

           <h2>Domain Name System</h2>
           <p>A hierarchical decentralized naming system for 
              computers, services, or other resources connected to 
              the Internet or a private network. It associates 
              various information with domain names assigned to 
              each of the participating entities.</p>

           <h2>Hypertext Transfer Protocol</h2>
           <p>An application protocol for distributed, 
               collaborative, and hypermedia information systems. 
               It is the foundation of data communication for the 
               World Wide Web. It is the standard protocol to 
               exchange or transfer hypertext.</p>
